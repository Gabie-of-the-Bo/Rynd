# Rynd

Rynd is a **multidimensional array library** for the [Ryna Programming Language](https://github.com/Gabie-of-the-Bo/Ryna-Language). You could understand this library as a wrapper for the fantastic [ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray) crate for Rust using FFI bindings. The Rynd layer adds type erasure in a similar way as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) does in order for it to be used easily from *Ryna*.

# State

Still in very early development. Expect **many** bugs and a badly documented API. It is being used as the main source of error detection and correction for *Ryna v0.10.0*.
